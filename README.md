## Query Structure

### Basic Structure of SQL Files

Each SQL file contains a query that retrieves data from Jira and GitHub. The queries are written in standard SQL and are designed for flexibility, supporting dynamic filtering and pagination.

- **Parameters**: Defined at the top of each file using comments in the RAW Labs format.
- **Filters**: Applied in the `WHERE` clause based on parameters.
- **Pagination**: Implemented using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

### Types of Queries

#### Level 1: Basic Queries

These queries retrieve data from single tables and support dynamic filtering and pagination.

**Example:**

```sql
-- @param github_repository_full_name Filter by GitHub repository name.
-- @type github_repository_full_name string
-- @default github_repository_full_name null

-- @param github_pull_request_number Filter by GitHub pull request number.
-- @type github_pull_request_number integer
-- @default github_pull_request_number null

-- @param page Current page number.
-- @type page integer
-- @default page 1

-- @param page_size Number of records per page.
-- @type page_size integer
-- @default page_size 25

-- @return A list of PR comments matching the specified filters with pagination.

WITH filtered_comments AS (
    SELECT
        comment.id AS comment_id,
        comment.pull_request_number AS pr_number,
        comment.created_at,
        comment.updated_at,
        comment.body,
        comment.author_username
    FROM github_pull_request_comments AS comment
    WHERE (comment.github_repository_full_name = :github_repository_full_name OR :github_repository_full_name IS NULL)
      AND (comment.github_pull_request_number = :github_pull_request_number OR :github_pull_request_number IS NULL)
)
SELECT *
FROM filtered_comments
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT COALESCE(:page_size, 25) OFFSET (COALESCE(:page, 1) - 1) * COALESCE(:page_size, 25);
```

#### Level 2: Intermediate Queries

These queries involve joins between multiple tables to provide more complex data retrieval.

**Example:**

```sql
-- @param github_repository_full_name Filter by GitHub repository name.
-- @type github_repository_full_name string
-- @default github_repository_full_name null

-- @param github_pull_request_number Filter by GitHub pull request number.
-- @type github_pull_request_number integer
-- @default github_pull_request_number null

-- @return A list of PR reviews with author details.

WITH pr_reviews AS (
    SELECT
        review.id AS review_id,
        review.pull_request_number AS pr_number,
        review.state,
        review.submitted_at,
        review.body,
        review.author_username
    FROM github_pull_request_reviews AS review
    WHERE (review.github_repository_full_name = :github_repository_full_name OR :github_repository_full_name IS NULL)
      AND (review.pull_request_number = :github_pull_request_number OR :github_pull_request_number IS NULL)
)
SELECT *
FROM pr_reviews
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

#### Level 3: Advanced Queries

These queries use advanced SQL techniques like window functions and subqueries to provide analytical insights.

**Example:**

```sql
-- @param jira_key Jira Issue Key to filter PRs.
-- @type jira_key string
-- @default jira_key null

-- @return PRs with associated Jira issues and their statuses.

WITH pr_with_jira AS (
    SELECT
        pr.number AS pr_number,
        pr.title AS pr_title,
        pr.created_at AS pr_created_at,
        pr.updated_at AS pr_updated_at,
        pr.url AS pr_url,
        pr_author.username AS pr_author_username,
        jira.key AS jira_issue_key,
        jira.summary AS jira_summary,
        jira.status AS jira_status,
        jira.assignee AS jira_assignee
    FROM github_pull_requests AS pr
    LEFT JOIN jira_issue AS jira ON LOWER(jira.key) = LOWER(pr.jira_key)
    LEFT JOIN github_users AS pr_author ON pr.author_id = pr_author.id
    WHERE (:jira_key IS NULL OR jira.key = :jira_key)
      AND pr.state = 'open'
)
SELECT *
FROM pr_with_jira
ORDER BY pr_created_at DESC;
```

## Filters and Pagination

### Filters

The template supports various types of filters for flexible querying:

| Filter Type          | Description                                                  | Example                                                                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Equality Filters** | Checks if a column's value equals the specified parameter or is NULL | `AND (j.key = :jira_key OR :jira_key IS NULL)`                                             |
| **Substring Search** | Searches for a substring within a column                     | `AND (j.summary ILIKE CONCAT('%', :jira_summary, '%') OR :jira_summary IS NULL)`            |
| **Range Filters**    | Filters data within a numeric or date range                  | `AND (pr.created_at >= :start_date OR :start_date IS NULL)`                                 |
| **List Filters**     | Matches any value from a list                                | `AND (pr.author_username IN (:reviewer_usernames) OR :reviewer_usernames IS NULL)`           |

### Pagination

The queries support pagination through `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

- **Parameters**:
  - `:page` (integer): The current page number (default is 1).
  - `:page_size` (integer): The number of records per page (default is 25).

**Example:**

```sql
LIMIT COALESCE(:page_size, 25)
OFFSET (COALESCE(:page, 1) - 1) * COALESCE(:page_size, 25);
```
